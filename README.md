### My Notes
After doing the tutorial and Quick Start on Vue.js as well as reading the docs. I had created an application and played with several features.

I am now starting back and going through the basic tutorials for things I may have missed. And will be recreating from there.

I also worked a bit with Tailwind CSS, but need more on the basics of Vue before diving deeper into Tailwind CSS.
